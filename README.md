# ipv6tools
A nodejs-based utility to translate ipv6 addresses to and from simple English phrases

These are hoped to be easier to remember, easier to call out across a busy server-room and shorter in terms of syllables.

Inspired by the location service what3words (http://what3words.com/)

### IPv4 Examples
